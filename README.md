# Task 20 - React - Routing

## About

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It's a simple web app used to practice the concept of Routing in React. It is an e-commerce website with a login page, about page, and catalogue page. React Routing is essential in building any type of React application as it allows the user to navigate the website. 

## How to use

1. Ensure you have NodeJS installed on your machine.
2. Download all files and folders to your local machine.
3. Place the files and folders into a new folder.
4. Open your terminal and navigate to the new folder you created.
5. Once in the folder run the following commands:
   
``` bash
npm install
```
This should install the node modules for the app to work.
``` bash
npm start
```
The React App should've now started on port 3000.

### Happy Coding!
